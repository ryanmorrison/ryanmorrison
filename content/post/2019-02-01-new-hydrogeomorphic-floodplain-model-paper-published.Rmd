The master's work of Kara Scheel has been published in [JAWRA](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.12717). This was an exciting collaboration with [Fernando Nardi](https://twitter.com/fnardi) and [Antonio Annis](https://twitter.com/AntoYears) from the University of Foreigners in Perugia, Italy, in which we applied a hydrogeomorphic floodping mapping model to explore the impacts of levees of floodplain inundation. Congrats to Kara!
