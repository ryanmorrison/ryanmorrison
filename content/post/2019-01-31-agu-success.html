<p>This was the first year taking a group of students to AGU, and it was a great experience. Not only were my students blown away by the scale of AGU, but <em>I wasn’t responsible for giving a single presentation</em>. I did, however, co-convene a session on socio-hydrologic resiliency, which was a great networking experience. Below are some of the highlights from this year’s trip.</p>
