Matt and Heechan made it through another hurdle along their PhD-path and passed their preliminary exams! Congratulations to [Matt]({{< ref "/authors/matt/_index.md" >}}), who passed his prelim exam in March while on campus before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. And today [Heechan]({{< ref "/authors/heechan/_index.md" >}}) passed his exam virtually. Both these guys have amazing dissertations forthcoming!
