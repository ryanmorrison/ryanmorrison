[Elaina]({{< ref "/authors/elaina/_index.md" >}}) gave a masterful presentation to pass her MS defense on Monday, June 28. The title of her thesis was "The development of a decision support system for concurrently evaluating changes in instream and floodplain habitats caused by flow modifications".

Elaina joined me during fall 2018 after completing her undergraduate degree in Biological Systems Engineering from Virginia Tech. During her MS research she was involved with a large collaborative project funded by the USGS. As with many collaborative projects, it was great working with so many experts but also contains its own challenges associated with the shifting pace and needs of collaborative work. She navigated these challenges very well, especially since her MS project was essentially the integrator of all disciplines as the "downstream ends" of the project.
