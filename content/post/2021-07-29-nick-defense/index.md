It was a pleasure to see [Nick]({{< ref "/authors/nick/_index.md" >}})  successfully passed his MS exam! Nick put together an impressive thesis and presentation describing the results of 3D hydrodynamic modeling efforts that examined the impact of floodplain vegetation on channel hydraulics. He is now off to Seattle to start a consulting job with Watershed Science and Engineering.
