<p>It was a pleasure giving an invited talk at the <a href="http://res-ins.unm.edu">3rd Annual UNM Resilience Colloquium</a>. The colloquium was filled with interesting discussions of managing human and natural systems for resilience. I was able to meet up with my PhD advisor, Mark Stone, and eat too many green chiles! Thank you, Dr. Stone and Dr. Taha, for the invitation.</p>
<p>P.S. My department colleague, <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~hmahmoud/_">Hussam Mahmoud</a>, gave an awesome keynote talk.</p>
