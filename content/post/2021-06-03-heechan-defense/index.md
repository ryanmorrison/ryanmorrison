This news is a bit dated (like this website!), but [Heechan]({{< ref "/authors/heechan/_index.md" >}}) has successfully passed his PhD exam and is starting a new postdoc positon at Texas A&M. To celebrate his success, we finally were able to get the crew together for some food and drinks.

Heehcan is my first PhD student to complete his degree, and I couldn't be prouder of his success.
