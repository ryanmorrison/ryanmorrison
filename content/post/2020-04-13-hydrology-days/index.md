Danny White and Elaina Paserro gave great virtual presentations at Hydrology Days 2020. [Danny]({{< ref "/authors/danny/_index.md" >}}) presented on our work to understand the impacts of climate change on Greenback Cutthroat Trout habitat in the Front Range of Colorado, and [Elaina]({{< ref "/authors/elaina/_index.md" >}}) described her near-complete work to develop a decision support tool for environmental flows on the Verde River. Congrats to both on pulling together impressive presentations in the midst of a pandemic!
