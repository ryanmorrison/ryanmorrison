I am excited to announce that I'm part of a new NSF Sustainable Regional Systems Research Network [award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2115169&HistoricalAwards=false)! This $15 million award includes the participation of eight academic institutions and dozens of community partners. The Research Network is led by [Mark Stone](https://civil.unm.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/mark-stone.html) at the University of New Mexico, and I'm thrilled to be leading the CSU sub-award with the help of a strong interdisciplinary group including [Aditi Bhaskar](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ce/aditi-bhaskar/), [Kelly Jones](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/kelly-jones/), [Camille Stevens-Rumann](https://people.warnercnr.colostate.edu/?Camille.StevensRumann), and [Dale Manning](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/people/faculty/dale-manning/). 

This Network uses a convergent research approach to explore how a guided transformation framework can be employed to build synergistic system connectivity across urban-rural gradients to promote sustainable cities, landscapes, and livelihoods across the Intermountain West (IMW). The Network's diverse academic disciplines and non-academic partnerships will embrace and integrate western and Indigenous cultural knowledge and use a system-of-systems research approach to advance the theory and applied knowledge of the dynamics, resilience, and transformational opportunities of urban-rural systems. In so doing, the Network will increase traditional and western knowledge of regional sustainability with cultural open-mindedness and scientific granularity, while identifying and addressing real-world ecosystem issues and community challenges. Through broad cross-disciplinary integration, the Network targets creation of impact through fundamental and use-inspired science projects, advancing sustainability science through regional-scale implementation of projects in the IMW. The Network intends to advance GT theories for collaboratively and equitably transforming URS structures and processes towards sustainability.
