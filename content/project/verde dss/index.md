**Sponsor:** U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Forest Service

**Duration:** 2019â€“2023

**PI:** Ryan Morrison

**Students:** [Elaina Paserro]({{< ref "/authors/elaina/_index.md" >}})

The goal of this project is to develop a DSS tool to assist in synthesizing numerous model outputs to identify specific physical and biological habitat needs of select fish species in the Verde River. Outputs from the DSS will allow for improved habitat management, provide information to aid in protection of in-stream flows, riparian habitat, and contribute to recovery of endangered and sensitive native fish species.  The DSS will utilize data and model outputs from co-occurring projects on habitat suitability criteria and riparian vegetation being conducted across the Verde River and several other Arizona rivers and streams in the development of river specific and generalized habitat suitability criteria.
