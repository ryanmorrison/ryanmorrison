**About Me:** My name is Matthew and I am from Lawrence, KS where I received a BS and MS at the University of Kansas in civil engineering with concentrations in environmental engineering and water resources, respectively. If I ever get free time I fill it with tennis, hiking, biking, cooking, fishing, and reading National Geographic. Somewhere between my early graduate work and my undergrad, I discovered higher education was a passion of mine. The allotted time to think, with curiosity as the main driver, about the frontiers of hydrology, ecology and water resources is a true love of mine.

**Research Focus:** For my research at Colorado State University, I am extremely grateful to be working with Dr. Morrison on a multidisciplinary project that aims to quantify the response of riparian vegetation (“the effect”) when impacted by variables describing the energy-and-mass balance as well as changes in agricultural practices (“the causes”) in an arid climate. My research aims to answer this science question by approaching it at two spatial scales. At a basin scale, groundwater model output, climate data sets, factors that represent anthropogenic influence, and data sets representing riparian response will be assimilated to statistically analyze in a hierarchical framework. At the field scale, an innovative network of sensors will operate autonomously to collect the effective variables that describe specie-specific riparian response in a groundwater-dependent ecosystem. This research has broad implications related to water efficiency, innovative technology and adoption into natural-ecosystem monitoring, wetland conservation and statistical tools for ecological engineers.
