**About Me:** I grew up all over the United States and received my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Geosciences from Notre Dame followed by a master’s degree in geography from the University of Texas.  I’ve really enjoyed biking around Fort Collins and exploring the area’s streams and trails.   

**Research Focus:** I am fortunate to have two great advisors: Professors Morrison and Wohl.  We are attempting to determine how artificial levees impact floodplain extent at the national level in the USA.  The first part of the project is making an estimate of the completeness of the National Levee Database using the database as training data in machine learning models.  Then, we are using our knowledge of artificial levee locations to map hydrogeomorphic floodplains with and without levee impacts.  The final part of the project is determining how artificial levees impact floodplain integrity.
