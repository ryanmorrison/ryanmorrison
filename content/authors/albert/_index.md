**About Me:** Hello! My name is Albert, I am a first-generation student
from the Roaring Fork Valley here in Colorado and am pursuing a BS in
Civil Engineering. I enjoy running, hiking, and being outside in the
great outdoors. Otherwise, I have a passion for cooking, reading on
philosophy, and learning about the wonders of life. I am heavily
involved in the College of Engineering and enjoy serving my community.

**Research Focus:** I joined Dr. Morrison's research group in the fall
of 2019 through the Scott Undergrad Research Experience (SURE) program.
I work alongside Matthew Lurtz, a Ph.D. student at CSU, on a
multidisciplinary project in the Lower Arkansas River Valley. This
project is aimed to quantify the response of riparian vegetation
impacted by energy-and-mass balance variables and changes in
agricultural practices within an arid climate. My duties have included
assisting in field research and construction of stations with various
sensors to assist in data collection. I also focus on data and
statistical analysis, all while informing myself on the implications and
importance of water efficiency, innovative technologies and
natural-ecosystem monitoring, wetland conservation, and statistical
tools for the benefit of the research and ecological engineers. I am
beyond grateful to have this amazing opportunity and am excited to see
where my skills from this project will take me later in my career and
life.
