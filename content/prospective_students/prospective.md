*I've borrowed heavily from the well-thought out student expectation of [Adam Ward](http://www.indiana.edu/~hydro/openings.html) and [Melissa Wilson-Sayres](http://mathbionerd.blogspot.com/2014/06/new-academic-lab-thoughts-recruiting.html)*

## Graduate Students

**My responsibilities to my graduate students:**

- Assist with identifying and writing for graduate student fellowships
- Work collaboratively to develop and execute a research project
- Discuss future career goals (e.g., do you want to teach, go into academia, continue in research?), and plan ways to facilitate these goals
- Support travel to at least one scientific conference per year, if you have research results to present
- Meet weekly to discuss progress and plans
- Develop a list of short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals
- Help you maintain work-life balance during a difficult time in life (graduate school!)
- Facilitate a positive, critical environment in group meetings where your research is shared

**Expectations of my graduate students:**

- Participate in weekly lab meetings
- Prepare for our regular progress/pitfalls meetings and a follow up email of progress and goals
- Maintain a set of lab notes, including directories of data, annotated codes & versions, detailed methods. These need to sufficient to reproduce results without additional instructions.
- Write and submit a pre-doctoral fellowship proposal
- Proof-read manuscripts from other lab members
- Regularly attend departmental seminars
- Present a poster or talk of research progress at conference at least once a year.
- Participate in general lab responsibilities (servers, maintain common areas, taking turns hosting visitors)
